# Device Status App

The Device Status App is a cross-platform mobile application built using Flutter. It provides real-time information about the device's battery status, including battery level, health, temperature, voltage, and charging status. The app leverages Flutter's Platform Channels to communicate with native code for accessing platform-specific features.

## Features

- Display battery level as a percentage.
- Show battery health status (good, cold, dead, overheat, over voltage, unspecified failure, or unknown).
- Display battery temperature in degrees Celsius.
- Show battery voltage in millivolts (mV).
- Indicate battery charging status (charging, discharging, full, or not charging).
